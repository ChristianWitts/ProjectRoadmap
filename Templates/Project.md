### Details

An expanded explanation on the project, as well as the following if you have; links to supporting documentation, case reviews, A/B testing etc; that serves to inform everyone as to why this project is going ahead.

### Timelines

Does this project need to be delivered by Q1'18, next week (although you're probably late already if that's the case) etc.

Are there any project penalities to pay heed to ? ie. If the deliverable date is missed by a week, is there some financial obligation due to the client ?
